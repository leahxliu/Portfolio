        <h1>Out the Door</h1>
        <h3>December 2019</h3>
        <p>This is a group project I participated in. Students were to pick out 12 items out of 40 or so items deemed to have good design by ourselves and other students and tie them to a theme. The theme my group picked is everyday essentials. The idea behind our project is that it acts as a piece of functional decoration. It serves the purpose of a checklist for the useer before they walk out the door. The panels have the product shown on the front and a brief description laser-cut on the back. <br><br>We ideated as a group on various themes and concepts. I created the graphic style on the front and applied it with another girl to all of the panels, then I edited them all for continuity at the end for printing. The other two members did typesetting and laser-cutting.<br><br>Future development would include adding more panels for user customization or a larger board. Another direction the group breifly discussed was the addition of cubys or drawers for the item to be stored in.</p>
