        <h1>AWARE Magazine Spread</h1>
        <h3>November 2020</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was tasked to create a magazine spread for an article from AWARE Women Artists. My article is about women artists and psychiatry. I incorporated the image from the article in the backround of the spread and manipulated the text to reflect the article's content. I made sure that the title text was still legible since it serves an important purpose. I used a two column system to improve readability and also made sure to include relevant information (like the artist, author, and source).<br><br>I have some greivances with this, but some of the elements were out of my control, such as the image used. I would've preffered a more impactful image to fill the space.<br><br><a href="https://awarewomenartists.com/en/decouvrir/soigner-le-genie-les-artistes-femmes-et-psychiatrie/"><p>Source Content: Women Artists in Psychiatry</p></a></p>
