        <h1>Noodles Poster</h1>
        <h3>November 2020</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was tasked to create a poster design for my semester long theme (in my case it was chinese cold noodles). I wanted to go for a playful yet sophisticated tone in my poster. Cold noodles are meant to be eaten in the summer so I wanted to communicate that. At first, I had the poster without the girl in the floatie. However, I wanted to communicate that cold noodles were to be eaten on hot days, so I added the girl in a swimsuit floating on the wavy noodles.<br><br>I ideated a lot before I landed on a design. After that, I flipped between two designs and agonized over small changes for a week. I'm happy with how the poster turned out especially after putting so much effort into it. Prior to this project I ironically had also sketched food craving posters on my own out of longing.</p>
