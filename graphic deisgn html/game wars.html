        <h1>Game Wars</h1>
        <h3>March 2019</h3>
        <p>I made this poster for an event at my high school called Game Wars. This event is hosted by the school in the fall and hosted at the expo center in the spring. The spring event is pretty big, so they needed a sophisticated poster and I was to design it. <br><br>The theme for the event that year was "neo-deco" so I did a lot of research and found some graphic styles relating to neo deco and just built upon the poster until I and the faculty were satisfied. I'm really happy with the way it turned out especially with all of the details.</p>
