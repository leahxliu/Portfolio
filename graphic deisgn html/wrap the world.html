        <h1>Wrap the World</h1>
        <h3>December 2022</h3>
        <p>My partner Coco Lai and I created this zine over the course of a school year. Wrap the World is a collaborative and interactive 60 page zine exploring the delicious and diverse ways that people from different cultures wrap their food. Wrapping food has been a prevalent cooking technique for centuries. This project originated from exploring traditional leaf wrapped foods and later expanded to include a broader variety of wrapped foods. By designing this interactive zine about wrapped foods, we take a closer look at the history, ingredients, and preparation methods of these mouth-watering dishes.<br><br> Wrap the World has 4  main sections; celebration food, day to day foods, graphs, and write-it-yourself. In the celebration food section, each food has a description of the food, an interactive foldable with ingredients, and a step by step folding guide. The day to day foods section still has interactive elements but is simpler and includes a brief description of the wrapped food and illustrations of the food and its ingredients. The graph section features the foods on graphs and maps out where the featured food is from. Finally, we included a fill-in section. There are a lot of foods and wrapped foods and we could not include all of them. On the occasion that our readers' wrapped food from their culture is not included, they have the option of adding their own wrapped food into the book.
