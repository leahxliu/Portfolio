        <h1>Coderrect Logo</h1>
        <h3>August 2020</h3>
        <p>I was comissioned to create a logo for a company developing a multi-threaded race detection software called Coderrect. They wanted to have a modern and sleek design, reflecting a reliable and high-tech software.<br><br>I spent a few days drawing more thank 80 thumbnail sketches of potential logos and then I went into Adobe Illustrator and created the most viable logos. I also drew inspiration from other tech and code logos around today. After experimenting with different logos, I picked out the best designs and presented them to my employer. They favored one of my inital designs but wanted more options. I went back to ideating and repeated the proccess again. They eventually picked their inital favorite design. <br> <br>We then moved into font-finding. They wanted something compact and tech related due to the vertical nature of the logomark. I altered an existing font and made the font color grey to give emphasis to the logomark.<br><br>Finally, we began looking at colors. I came up with various gradients since they're popular at the moment, and also different single color options. We decided on a deep green color similar to their original logo color. After finally finishing the logo, I had also created different versions of the logo (black and white, vertical, horizonatl, etc.),<br><br>This is their site: <a href="https://coderrect.com/">https://coderrect.com/</a>.</p>
