        <h1>Interactive Ingredients</h1>
        <h3>December 2020</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was tasked to create an interactive design for my semester long theme. In response to the prompt, I created cards which displayed the ingredient and instructions on how to prepare a Chinese cold noodle dish. I designed the cards to be color coded; the coral color is for veggies; the yellow color is for the noodles/carbs, and the blue color is for the sauce. The cover card is all of the colors combined. <br><br>5"x7" waterproof cards bound by rings can be used by home cooks. Poster size displays can be used in restaurants serving food such as poke, ramen, or sandwiches.<br><br>Future development could include some exploration of different illustration styles. Another route this could take is multi-recipe ingredient use. This project explores cross-cultural and cross-generational similarities through food and has a lot of different directions it could go.</p>
