        <h1>Interactive Ingredients</h1>
        <h3>December 2020</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was tasked to create an interactive design for my semester long theme (in my case it was chinese cold noodles). In response to the prompt, I created cards which displayed the ingredient and instructions on how to prepare it. The cards are color coded as well; the coral color is for veggies; the yellow color is for carbs (in this case, noodles), and the blue color is for the sauce. The cover card is all of the colors combined. <br><br>I propose two ways to use these cards. The first is for home use; the cards are 5"x7", waterproof and bound by a ring for home cooks. The other way would be displayed as posters in restaurants where order customization is possible (such as poke, ramen, or sandwich shops).<br><br>Future development could include further exploration and development of the illustration style (different stroke weights or physically drawn illustrations). Another route this could take is having one ingredient be used for multiple recipies. The multi-ligual and multi-cultural element is also a viable route to explore.<br><br>Originally, the concept I had for this project was more analog. I was thinking of doing something more tactile like a flipbook or a pop-up book. However, due to time restraints I scrapped that idea and went with this instead. I think the popup book is way out of my depth and would take many months of research to achieve. However, I am very happy with how this project turned out.</p>
