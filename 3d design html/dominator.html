            <h1>Prop Remake</h1>
            <h3>May 2020</h3>
            <p>This is a personal project I am doing during my breaks from school. The references I am using for this project can be found in the Japanese show 'Psycho Pass,' the prop which I am creating is called the Dominator and is a weapon used to punish deviants. I had made a version of the Dominator in 2015 but I wanted to remake it since my original version was rather flat and had some wrong dimensions. The new version is still in the works, but I am happy with how it is progressing.</p>
