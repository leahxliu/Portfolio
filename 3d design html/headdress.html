            <h1>Wearable Headdress</h1>
            <h3>April 2020<br>Painted Cardboard</h3>
            <p>I created a wearable headdress for a distant civilization. The concept behind this is that the people of a far away planet with being similar to ourselves wear headdresses to show their status. The headdresses resemble beetles on Earth. The more elaborate the headdress, the higher the status. Worker/common people have very simple headdresses with few horns and adornments. The headdress I made is for a high ranking officer or general. <br><br>First, I sketched out different forms and horn placements on the headdress. Then, I measured the relevant parts of my face and began cutting, folding, and glueing the cardbaord. Once I was done constructing and trying it on, I painted the headdress.<br><br>The bottom section hangs on outcrops from the top section.</p>
