        <h1>Kid's Food Tray</h1>
        <h3>April 2020</h3>
        <p>I used Rhinoceros to 3D model a kids food tray. The model is 1.25" tall and about 9" wide. The material would be firm sillicone. I designed the food tray to look like a raccoon because kids items are often animal or toy shaped. I wanted the food tray to be more dimensional so I made the whole tray rounded at the top. I also filleted all the inner edges considering cleaning. Additionally, I added the iconic raccoon mask and small details to add to the raccoon appearance such as teeth, ear indents, and whiskers.<br><br>One of the most challenging parts of this project was making the rounded top since it's such an organic shape. I'm really happy with how the model turned out, and it came out pretty much exactly how I wanted it to.</p>
