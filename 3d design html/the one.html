        <h1>The One Packaging</h1>
        <h3>April 2020</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was asked to create packaging for a kit and situate it in an environment. The kit I created and packaged is a cup kit. The idea behing "the One" is that it can be the one cup someone uses. The kit includes a cup mending kit (of epoxy) in case the cup breaks or chips, a bag for carrying, and a note stating the message and uses.<br><br>I created the packaging with cereal box cardboard, cardstock, and cloth. I printed the outer designs onto cardstock, cut them out and then pasted it onto the box. <br><br>I situated my kit and packaging in a Japanese bookstore Kinokuniya because their products are high craft and quality, which also means longevity. My kit would situate well with the elegant packaging design and message.<br><br>Pictured at the bottom is the process of opening the kit and its contents.</p>
