        <h1>Honey Kiss</h1>
        <h3>November 2020</h3>
        <p>For this project, I created a 3D model in Rhinoceros for honey packaging and its accompanying kit and packaging. I also created various kit covers. Each kit is a different combination of honey and tea; the box would also have an introduction to the kinds of teas and honeys available. The kit consists of the honey, a box of tea, and an informational pamphlet describing the uses of the honey with the tea and why the combination works; it would also describe alternative uses for the honey. <br><br>The intended audience would really be for anyone who drinks tea and is open to exploring honey and tea pairings.</p>
