            <h1>Stackable Cups</h1>
            <h3>March 2020</h3>
            <p>After studying cups for two months, I was tasked to create my own. I created a new stackable cup which is useful for a family and saving space in cupboards. Each cup could have its own design and be part of a series. I wanted to hone in on space saving and after 40 somewhat ridiculous iterations, I stuck with a stackable cup. <br><br>I 3D modelled this in Rhinoceros and then had it 3D printed. The actual cup would be both wider and taller and have a slightly larger and more smoothed handle. The ideal materials would be either completely ceramic or the handle would be metal and the cup itself would be ceramic.</p>
