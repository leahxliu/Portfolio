        <h1>Farm to Table Redesign</h1>
        <h3>March 2020</h3>
        <p>This was a group project to redesign an E-Commerce site. My group decided to redesign the Farm to Table website. This was the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Farm to Table had not updated it's site yet.<br><br>First, the group did a heuristic evaluation of Farm to Table's website at the time and determined what aspects of the site we liked and wanted to include in our own design. Conversely, we looked at the aspects that we wanted to change or redo. Since Farm to Table is an E-Commerce site, my group modelled the purchasing interface after HEB's purchasing interface. We also included farmer profiles and the mission statement from the original site. Additionally, my group added a checkout page and the login feature. I developed the style elements such as the fonts and colors and thee layout for some of the pages.<br><br>As of now, Farm to Table has a new site design and is leagues better than its old one.<br><br>Working Prototype: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/h8CF9X2OT8Dz0tRMy7Bbi0/E-Commerce-Farm-To-Table?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom">Figma Clickable Prototype</a></p>
